                        Growing up in Canberra in the 1950s & ’60s was an immersive Modernist experience for David Brand, a Melbourne based architect born and raised in Deakin. Their houses and gardens express the ideals of Modern Australian living, in a Post-War age of austerity, and optimism.
                        Following the walk, join Canberra Modern and David Brand for an 'In Conversation' further reflecting on his childhood neighbourhood — its houses, gardens, society and attitudes, its unique Canberran demographics.

                        Built in 1954, University House was the crown jewel of the newly established Australian National University, but more than just accommodation for staff and students, the building offered a secret safe haven in the event of a military attack on the capital in the form of complex underground tunnels. 
                        Join Canberra Modern’s Amy Jarvis and Tim the Yowie Man on a behind the scenes tour of these tunnels and learn how this building, and the rest of ANU hold a myriad of secrets and mysteries within their design and history.

                        Growing up in Canberra in the 1950s & ’60s was an immersive Modernist experience for David Brand, a Melbourne based architect born and raised in Deakin. 
                        His illustrated talk reflects his childhood neighbourhood -- its houses, gardens, society and attitudes, its unique Canberran demographics.  A seed-bed of Australian Modernism, seen in three suburban blocks.

                        This symposium explores Canberra’s Modern/Modernist architecture and planning, widely employed in the city in the mid-20th century,  of international standing and embodying the aspirations of a young nation. 
                        The diverse program features local and interstate perspectives, exploring Canberra's modernist heritage from different angles: design for learning; conserving the marble facade of the National Library; a creative approach to engagement with Northbourne Ave's at risk public housing precinct; working with planning legislation; managing Canberra's mid century landscapes; lessons from Sydney, Hobart and Armidale about valuing, conserving and celebrating our mid century spaces and places. 
                        Take a tour of ANU's mid-century architecture; get involved in a panel discussion on key issues; end the day with a light-hearted look at the symbiotic relationship between cocktail culture and mid century life in the capital.
                        Come along to check out the amazing architecture and interiors of the R.N Robertson Building at ANU - originally designed as the Research School of Biological Sciences by Hely and Horne with Macdonald Eggleston and Secomb in 1972, the space was recently refurbished by CCJ Architects (who won an award for this project from the Australian Institute of Architects).
                        Canberra Modern is proud to be a supporter of the 2018 symposium. At Canberra Modern we are committed to building awareness and understanding of Canberra’s unique modernist heritage places and spaces and encouraging conservation through participation.

                        Talking points will present recent works from makers connected with the gold and silversmithing program at The ANU School of Art and Design. 
                        A boardroom table located in the Torrance Room at University House will function as a backdrop for this exhibition. 
                        The exhibition will present a diverse range of dialogues, interests and concerns that have emerged through the gold and silversmithing studio over the last 40 years. 
                        The table is an appropriate platform for the interests the exhibition presents, as a place where complex dialogues converge. 
                        Themes explored include cross-cultural enquiry, material and sensorial concerns and the intersection of visual languages.

                        When the building was refurbished in 2014, many of the original fittings such as early Bakelite switches and power points, Negretti & Zambra thermographs, pressure gauges, fans and bells were salvaged by ANU Heritage, and repurposed into sculptural assemblages by artist and archaeologist Martin Rowney.

                        Grant Featherston is best known for his plywood Contour chairs developed in the early 1950s. However the Contour series just marked the start of a thirty year career in chair design. Working with Melbourne -based manufacturer Aristoc, Grant later joined by his wife Mary, designed hundreds of chairs some of which were so commercially successful that it is no exaggeration to claim that nearly everyone over thirty in Australia has sat on a Featherston chair. Surprisingly, very little has been published on the work of Australia's most successful mid-century designers. In September this year the first monograph was published by Thames and Hudson. This 300 page book features over 250 photographs highlighting the breadth of the Featherston’s designs, focusing on the 13 year partnership with Aristoc an featuring many previously unpublished images from the company's archive.
                        Author Geoff Isaac will present an illustrated overview of the Featherstons' work in chair design and the will be followed by a book signing.

                        While Harry Seidler is one of Australia’s most famous architects, little is known of his European-born contemporaries. The newly released title The Other Moderns uncovers the work of these forgotten émigré architects, interior designers, and furniture makers working and reveals their ground breaking impact on modernist design. 
                        The Other Moderns explores the work of this unacknowledged group of style makers for the first time in a richly illustrated publication including stunning images from Austrian-born photographer Margaret Michaelis and furniture from the collection of Hotel Hotel Canberra. 
                        Author Rebecca Hawcroft will speak on her research for the book and focus on some of Canberra’s many fascinating émigré stories and the connections that intertwine with the designers featured in the book and the exhibition ‘The Moderns’, currently showing at Museum of Sydney.
